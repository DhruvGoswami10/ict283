WEATHER DATA ANALYSIS SYSTEM - EVALUATION REPORT

================================================================================
WHAT WORKS
================================================================================

Core Data Structures:
- Date class works as required with proper constructors and accessors
- Time class works as required with string parsing and formatting capabilities
- Vector template class works as required with dynamic resizing and memory management
- WeatherRecord class properly encapsulates weather measurement data
- All classes provide proper getter/setter methods with appropriate return types

File I/O Operations:
- Data source file reading process works as required (data_source.txt → CSV filename)
- No need to recompile to read different files - configurable through data_source.txt
- Error messages are shown when files cannot be read or opened
- Proper error handling for missing data_source.txt file
- CSV parsing handles comma-separated values correctly

Data Loading and Processing:
- Headers are loaded correctly from CSV files with proper column detection
- Data is loaded correctly with appropriate data type conversions
- Missing data handling works properly (empty, "NA", "N/A" values skipped)
- Solar radiation filtering implemented correctly (only records ≥ 100 W/m² included)
- Date/time parsing from WAST column functions properly
- Numeric data conversion (string to float) works as expected

Menu System:
- Menu options work as required with proper user interface
- All 5 menu options implemented and functional:
  1. Wind speed statistics analysis
  2. Temperature statistics analysis  
  3. Solar radiation totals calculation
  4. CSV export functionality
  5. Program exit
- Menu navigation and option selection works correctly
- Invalid menu options handled with appropriate error messages

Statistical Analysis:
- Wind speed calculations work correctly with unit conversion (m/s to km/h)
- Temperature statistics calculated properly (mean and standard deviation)
- Solar radiation totals computed correctly with unit conversion (W/m² to kWh/m²)
- Month/year filtering functions properly for data analysis
- Mean and standard deviation calculations implemented correctly
- "No data available" messages displayed when appropriate

Data Export:
- File writing for option 5 (CSV export) works as intended
- WindTempSolar.csv file created with proper formatting
- Year-based data export functions correctly
- Missing data handled appropriately in export ("No Data mate" message)
- CSV format includes: Month,WindSpeed(StdDev),,Temp(StdDev),,SolarRadiation

Memory Management:
- Vector class properly manages dynamic memory allocation
- Copy constructor and assignment operator work correctly (deep copy)
- Destructor properly deallocates memory to prevent leaks
- Automatic resizing when vector capacity exceeded
- No memory leaks detected in normal operation

Unit Conversions:
- Wind speed conversion (m/s × 3.6 = km/h) implemented correctly
- Solar radiation conversion (W/m² × (1/6) ÷ 1000 = kWh/m²) works properly
- Conversion factors applied consistently throughout analysis

Documentation:
- Comprehensive Doxygen comments provided for all classes and methods
- UML diagrams accurately represent class relationships
- Data dictionary covers all class members with descriptions
- Pseudocode provided for both high-level and low-level implementations
- Test plans document all major functionality with expected results

================================================================================
WHAT DOESN'T WORK
================================================================================

Input Validation Issues:
- Invalid month and year inputs are not properly handled in menu system
- getYear() method has no validation - accepts negative years and invalid values
- getMonth() method has basic validation but allows initial negative input
- No range checking for year values (accepts -1, 0, etc.)
- Invalid inputs do not crash the program but produce unexpected results

Menu Input Handling:
- Month input validation incomplete - negative values can be entered initially
- Year input completely lacks validation allowing any integer value
- No error recovery mechanism for invalid input types
- User must restart menu operation after invalid input

Error Messages:
- Some error conditions not clearly communicated to user
- Input validation errors don't provide clear guidance for correction
- No helpful prompts for valid input ranges in some cases

Data Validation:
- Date and Time classes accept invalid values without validation
- No checking for logical date/time constraints (e.g., day > 31, hour > 23)
- WeatherRecord accepts any numeric values without range validation

Edge Cases:
- Behavior undefined for extremely large datasets
- No handling for malformed CSV files beyond basic error checking
- Limited error recovery for partially corrupted data files

User Experience:
- No confirmation prompts for destructive operations
- Limited feedback during long-running operations
- No progress indicators for data loading

Performance Considerations:
- Vector resizing could be inefficient for very large datasets
- No optimization for repeated month/year filtering operations
- Linear search used for column index finding

================================================================================
SPECIFIC ISSUES IDENTIFIED
================================================================================

Critical Issues (Affect Functionality):
1. getYear() method lacks input validation entirely
   - Location: menu.cpp, getYear() function
   - Impact: Accepts negative years, causing incorrect analysis results
   - Test Cases Failed: 13, 16, 19 (invalid year input handling)

2. Month validation allows negative input initially
   - Location: menu.cpp, getMonth() function  
   - Impact: User can enter negative months before validation loop catches it
   - Test Case Failed: 12 (invalid month input handling)

Minor Issues (Don't Break Core Functionality):
3. No input type validation (e.g., entering letters instead of numbers)
4. Limited user guidance for input format requirements
5. No confirmation for file operations
